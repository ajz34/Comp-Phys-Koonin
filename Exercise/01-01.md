## Exercise 1.1

Using any function for which you can evaluate the derivatives analytically, investigate the accuracy of the formulations in Table 1.2 for various values of $h$.

### Solution

Since I have printed the `Table 1.1` for the FORTRAN version, the code there can be utilized to solve this solution only by changing the output format and the equations required to be printed.

In my answer, only the 4 & 5 - points methods for 2nd derivatives are shown here. The FORTRAN code is available in `01-01.for`, as well as the solution is printed in `01-01.txt`.
