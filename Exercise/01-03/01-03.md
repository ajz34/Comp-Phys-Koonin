## Exercise 1.3

Write a program to calculate
\[
\int_0^1 t^{-2/3} (1-t)^{-1/3} \mathrm{d}t = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt 3}
\]
using one of the quadrature formulas discussed above and investigate its accuracy for various values of $h$.

> Hint: Split the range of integration into two parts and make a different change of variable in each integral to handle the singularities.

### Solution

Split the calculation into two integrals: from $0$ to $1/2$, and from $1/2$ to $1$. The first part can be evaluated as
\[
3\int_0^{0.5^{1/3}} (1-u^3)^{-1/3} \mathrm{d}u \sim 2.506947
\]
and the second part can be evaluated as
\[
\frac 3 2 \int_0^{0.5^{3/2}} (1-u^{3/2})^{-2/3} \mathrm{d}u \sim 1.120652
\]

The run the program and you can see the result from the screen. The calculation method is choosing 512 integral grid intervals and calculate by the Boole's Rule (5-point).
