## Exercise 1.5

Write programs to solve for the positive root of $x^2-5$ using the Newton-Raphson and secant methods. Investigate the behavior of the latter with changes in the initial guess for the root.

### Solution

This program have already done in the `Table 1.4` generator in the `ErrTable` dir.
