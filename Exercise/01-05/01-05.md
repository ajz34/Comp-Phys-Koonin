## Exercise 1.5

Write programs to solve for the positive root of $x^2-5$ using the Newton-Raphson and secant methods. Investigate the behavior of the latter with changes in the initial guess for the root.

### Solution

This program have already done in the `Table 1.4` generator in the `ErrTable` dir.

Change this program is simple: for Newton-Raphson method, initial guess is stored in the variable `DNTPR`, while for secant method, `DSCPR1` and `DSCPR2`. The threshold is controlled by the worst convergence appearance among the three methods this book introduced. You can also change the desired function and it's analytic derivate form by changing the subroutines `DFUNC` and `DDERV`.
