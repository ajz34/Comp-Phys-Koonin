## Exercise 1.2

Using any function whose definite integral you can compute analytically, investigate the accuracy of the various quadrature methods discussed above for different of $h$.

### Solution

The codes from the generation of `Table 1.3` can be utilized for this exercise. In my code, you can change the integral upper or lower limit by `xMAX` and `xMIN` , the integral grid number `N` , and the function `xFUNC` and it's integral `xINTG` ( `x` = `S` for single precision and `D` for double precision). I choose this following integral for evaluation:
\[
\int_0^1 \sin(x) = -cos(x) \Bigr\vert_0^1
\]

The results are presented by `01-02.txt` .
