## Exercise 1.9

Invariance of results under changes in the numerical algorithms or their parameters can give additional confidence in a calculation. Change the tolerances for the turning point and energy searches or the number of Simpson's rule points (this can be done at run-time by choosing menu option 2) and observe the effects on the results. Note that because of the way in which the expected number of bound states is calculated (see the end of subroutine `PARAM` ) this quantity can change if the energy tolerance is varied.

### Solution

If all the tolerances are changed to the minimum, the number of the states then become correct (13), as the program's output file shows in this directory.
