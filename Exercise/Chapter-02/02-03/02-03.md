## Exercise 2.3

Apply the Taylor series method (2.10) and the implicit method (2.18) to the example of Eq.(2.7) and obtain the results shown in Table 2.1. Investigate the accuracy of integration to larger values of $x$.

### Solution

As the output file shows, the absolute error for larger values of $x$ is much smaller than that of the smaller $x$. However, we should bear in mind the fact that the larger $x$ means much smaller $y = e^{-x^2/2}$.
